## 🤝 Contributing as a Guest Member

We welcome contributions! If you've worked with us on a project, you can get yourself featured on our site as a **Guest Contributor**.

3. **Add your profile photo** to `/public/guests/` (e.g., `YourName.jpeg`)

       bio: "A short bio about yourself.",         // 1-2 sentences
       image: "/guests/YourName.jpeg",             // Path to your photo
       skills: ["React", "TypeScript", "Figma"],   // 3-6 top skills
       socials: {
         github: "https://github.com/yourusername",
         linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",  // optional
         portfolio: "https://yoursite.dev"                  // optional
       },
       project: "Project Name",                    // Which project you helped with
       contribution: "What you worked on."         // Brief description
     },
   ];
   ```
