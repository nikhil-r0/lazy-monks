### **Building for Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025**

**Problem Statement ID:** ID25039
**Theme:** Disaster Management | **Category:** Software
**Organization:** INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services)

**Samudra Prahari** (Guardian of the Ocean) is a resilient, end-to-end platform designed to bridge the information gap during coastal hazards. It transforms everyday citizen smartphones and social media streams into a verified, real-time intelligence grid, ensuring that authorities can act when seconds matter most.

---

## The Core Philosophy: "Built for the Real World"

When natural disasters strike, most reporting systems fail due to two critical reasons: **Network Collapse** and **Low User Adoption**. With Samudra Prahari, we set out to solve both of these fundamental flaws:

1. **Resilience in Crisis:** We engineered an offline-first mobile app powered by **P2P BLE Mesh Networking**. This ensures that distress reports and critical updates can hop from device to device, eventually reaching authorities even when traditional cellular towers are completely down.
2. **Everyday Engagement:** To ensure the network is actually populated when a disaster occurs, we built the **"Coastal Companion"** suite. By offering daily utilities like tide forecasts and tourist guides, the app remains an active, daily habit for coastal communities 365 days a year.

---

## The Ecosystem Architecture

Building this solution required a multi-faceted approach to handle data collection, processing, and visualization. We divided the platform into three primary pillars:

### 1. The Mobile Application: The Ground Truth Sensor
Our mobile app is the frontline of the ecosystem.
* **Offline Reporting:** Built with React Native (Expo) and utilizing Bluetooth mesh communication protocols, users can communicate completely off-grid.
* **Multilingual Support:** We designed a localized interface to ensure accessibility for diverse coastal communities across India.
* **User Retention Ecosystem:** Gamified features like beach cleanliness reporting and reward badges keep users engaged.

### 2. The AI Scraper: The Digital Pulse
To supplement on-the-ground reports, we tap into the wider digital conversation.
* **Social Intelligence:** We developed automated Python pipelines to monitor platforms like X (Twitter) and Instagram for real-time disaster indicators.
* **Decoupled Scaling:** This system operates entirely independently of our main API, allowing 24/7 monitoring without slowing down the core application.
* **Auto-Cleaning & Verification:** An intelligent pipeline automatically de-duplicates redundant posts and flags potentially fabricated information.

### 3. The Web Dashboard: The Command Center
Authorities need a clear, actionable view of the chaos.
* **Geospatial Intelligence:** Our Next.js & Leaflet-based map view uses **PostGIS/PostgreSQL** to logically cluster real-time reports geographically, preventing information overload.
* **AI Analysis Core:** We integrated **IndicBERT** for multilingual NLP and computer vision to verify the authenticity of reported hazards before they escalate to emergency responders.
* **Role-Based Access:** Secure, tiered access ensures that different levels of responders get the specific data they need.

---

## Key Innovations

Throughout the development for SIH 2025, our team pushed the boundaries of what a disaster management tool could be:
* **Geospatial Intelligence:** Native database support for clustering nearby reports allows analysts to instantly distinguish between isolated incidents and large-scale disasters.
* **AI-Powered Verification:** Our multi-stage pipeline assigns "Confidence Scores" to incoming data, actively filtering out "fake news" or outdated footage to prevent resource misallocation.
* **P2P Mesh Network:** We successfully implemented functional decentralized communication, creating a reliable lifeline in true zero-connectivity zones.

### **Uncovering the Truth with Autonomous AI**

In an era of deepfakes, misinformation, and overwhelming data sprawl, manual investigation is becoming impossibly slow. **Veris** was built to flip the script. 

Developed for **Recurzive V2**, the Veris Ecosystem is not just a search engine—it is an autonomous investigative AI agent. It doesn't just fetch links; it actively reads, verifies, builds knowledge graphs, and iteratively reasons through complex queries until it finds the truth.

---

## The Cognitive Engine: LangGraph Backend

The heart of Veris is its backend intelligence, built with Python and LangGraph. Instead of a simple prompt-response loop, we engineered a stateful, looped pipeline controlled by an \`AgentState\` object. This allows the AI to "think" in steps, mimicking a human detective:

1. **The Collector:** The agent begins by scouring online sources, actively fetching raw data and potential evidence related to the user's query.
2. **The Verifier:** Not all data is equal. This node acts as a critical filter, cross-referencing information, evaluating credibility, and assigning trust scores to the evidence.
3. **The Graph Node:** As verified facts emerge, the system synthesizes them into a relationship map, connecting entities, events, and evidence logically.
4. **The Refiner:** The AI evaluates its own findings. *Do we have enough to conclude the investigation?* If not, it formulates a \`next_query\` and loops back to the Collector. If yes, it finalizes the investigation.
5. **The Reporter:** Finally, the agent compiles the structured data into a comprehensive, readable report.

This autonomous looping means the agent can go down rabbit holes, hit dead ends, pivot, and ultimately return with a highly verified conclusion.

### **Rewilding the Concrete Jungle**

Between 2000 and 2020, rapidly urbanizing cities in India lost over 20% of their green cover. In just ten years, Delhi alone lost 111,000 trees to construction and pollution. The result? "Urban heat islands" where temperatures soar 3-5°C higher than surrounding areas, contributing to stress, depression, and poor air quality. 

While parks and roadside plants exist, they often dry out and die due to a lack of regular watering and citizen engagement. Built for the **Social Hackathon 2025**, **Green Quest** was created by our team, the *Lazy Monks*, to solve this exact problem by gamifying environmental sustainability.

---

## The Core Concept: Become a Guardian

Green Quest transforms ordinary citizens into localized environmental heroes. Using our interactive map interface, users can locate and "adopt" plants in their immediate vicinity, becoming their official Guardians.

To keep users engaged, we introduced a dynamic quest system:
* **Actionable Quests:** Users receive regular tasks such as watering their adopted plant, submitting health reports, and tracking growth.
* **AI Verification:** To ensure authenticity, users submit photos and videos of their tasks. Our AI/ML service analyzes the media to identify the species, verify the plant's health score, and confirm that the quest was genuinely completed.
* **Competitive Sustainability:** A global Eco-Leaderboard induces friendly competition, rewarding the most active guardians with points and recognition.

    content: `
### **Fixing the Broken Civic Complaint System**

Urban areas consistently face recurring civic issues like massive potholes, illegal garbage dumps, and broken infrastructure. These problems often go underreported or unresolved due to slow, opaque, and highly centralized complaint systems. 

Existing issue-reporting apps are fundamentally flawed: unresolved issues are prematurely marked as "resolved," they lack visualization tools for municipal authorities to make data-driven decisions, and there is near-zero public interaction or transparency. 

To put this in perspective: In Bengaluru alone, between April and December 2024, the BBMP reported 16,940 potholes. Despite an annual allocation of roughly ₹45 crore for repairs, over 7,000 potholes were left entirely unaddressed. **Urban Trust** was built by the *Lazy Monks* to solve this accountability crisis.

---

## The Urban Trust Solution

We engineered a platform that bridges the trust gap between citizens and the government through automation and transparency.

* **AI-Verified Issue Reporting:** Users can snap a photo of a civic issue. Instead of instantly going to a human, our AI automatically validates the complaint using the image input, description, and geolocation data.
* **Smart Map Visualization:** A real-time, interactive map tracks active, unresolved, and escalating issues across the city, giving both citizens and authorities a bird's-eye view of urban decay.
* **Automated Ward Routing:** The system automatically maps reported issues to specific municipal ward boundaries and routes them directly to the responsible local officials for faster action.
* **Duplicate Detection:** To prevent system overload, the platform automatically identifies similar reports in the exact same location, merging them to strengthen the verification of a single issue.
* **Citizen Feedback Loop:** Citizens can verify or actively dispute the resolution of reported issues, ensuring transparent closure and keeping authorities accountable.
* **Multilingual Inclusivity:** The UI supports regional languages (like Kannada), ensuring citizens from all backgrounds can easily report and track issues.

## The Virtual World of GameNest

GameNest solves the isolation of indie development by offering a 2D open-world platform where the developer community becomes an explorable map. Every developer gets a virtual "space" or "tower" to:

* **Host Live Demos:** Showcase playable games and link directly to GitHub repositories.
* **Interactive Exploration:** Allow users to physically walk their avatars around the 2D world and seamlessly enter different game spaces.
* **Playtest & Connect:** Engage directly with creators, offer feedback, and contribute to ongoing projects.

### **Bridging the Rural Healthcare Gap**

In rural areas, healthcare challenges extend far beyond limited resources—they are exacerbated by isolation, deep-rooted stigma around women's health issues, and a lack of timely support. For countless women, health problems go untreated for years simply due to a lack of accessible, trusted information.

Built for the **She Builds AI** hackathon, **HerHealth** was created to tackle these challenges holistically.

### **Democratizing Global Trade for SMBs**

For small and medium businesses (SMBs), expanding into global markets is often a logistical nightmare. Exporters are forced to navigate a labyrinth of complex trade regulations, fragmented government resources, and obscure incentive programs. Finding accurate tariff details or understanding compliance requirements can take weeks of manual research.

Built for the **Amazon Sambhav 2024** hackathon, **ExportEase** was designed to solve this exact problem. It acts as an intelligent, centralized platform that reduces the time, effort, and uncertainty exporters face when stepping onto the global stage.

### **Cultivating the Concrete Jungle**

Urban terrace farming is rapidly growing as city dwellers look for sustainable ways to grow their own food. However, both beginners and experienced gardeners often struggle with knowing exactly *what* to plant and *when*, given the micro-climates of their specific rooftops. 

Built for the **BuzzOnEarth India Hackathon 2024** at IIT Kanpur, **Green Terrace** bridges the gap between traditional gardening and modern AI. We created a supportive digital ecosystem tailored specifically for terrace farmers.
